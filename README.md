#Namaste React
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git remote add origin "path of repository"
git push origin main
what is npm?
npm full form is not node package manager ,go to npmjs.com
npm init - will create package.json file
why do we need Package.json file?
-it is a configuration for npm ,

what is bundler?🚀

- we are using parcel bundler
  two type of dependcies
- dev(for development)
- normal(prod)
  -npm install -D parcel
  -npx parcel index.html(npx- it is mean executing a package) - executing a package name
  parcel created a server for us and hosted our app and give port 1234( http://localhost:1234)

#Parcel Doing-
-Dev Build

- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement( doing file watching and whenever any file changes ,automatically refreshes the page)
  HMR uses a File Watching Algorithm - written in C++
  -Parce is doing Caching - for Faster builds
- Image Opitimization
  -Minification
  -Bundling
  -Compressing file
  -Consistent Hashing
  -Code Splitting
  -Differential bundling - to support older browsers
  -Diagnostic
  -Error Handling
  -Https
  -Tree Shaking - remove unused code
- Different dev and prod bundles
  for creating prod build(npx parcel build index.html)
  transpiling(babel is doing)
  difference bw tilde(~) and caret(^)
  ^ - where there is a minor upgrade in the version , it will install the minor version not major upgrade , it install itself.
  ~ when there is major upgrade.

what is package.lock json?
-it keeps track of what version is installed in your project.

what is gitignore file?

- it is a file which is used for ignoring any file/foler , which you dont want to push into your repository/branch.
  -whatever you can regenerate do not push on git.

react installation -

1. npm install react

- import in your JS file -> import React from 'react';
  2.npm install react-dom
  -import in your JS file ->import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

React Elements -
An element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties. It contains only information about the component type (for example, a Button), its properties (for example, its color), and any child elements inside it.

React.CreateElement.

props - properties

Components :
1.Functional Components
2.Class based Components

concept called config driven UI

#Namaste Food

*Header
-logo
-Nav items

Two Types of Export/Import

-Default Export/Import

export Default component;
import component from "path";

-Name Export/Import

export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";

#React Hooks

#hooks : it is a normal js utility or helper function.
-useState()032
-useEffect()
#State(Existing Condition): It is a basic hook which helps in maintain the states for previous value and updated value.

syntax : const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

state : it is a variable in which any value pass.
setState : it is a function which will update the value for state variable.
initialState : it is the initial value for state variable.
useState Use Cases/guidance :
1.Never create the state variables outside of the component.Always call it inside the functional component.
2.Always call and create state variables on the top of the function component(when function starts).because js is a synchronous single threaded language. it executes code line by line , so to avoid errors create on the top.
3.Never use/create state variables with if else condition.
4.Never use/create state variables inside for loop , inside functions.

we useState for rerendering the component/UI

Why React is so fast?
React can find out the difference B/W virtual DOMs and update them(Core of React Algorithm)
React is fast due to DOM manupulation
it keeps in sync your data layer & UI layer.
Virtual DOM
Reconciliation
React Fiber
Diff Algorithm

Reconciliaton algorithm/React Fiber :
The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

-----Class-6-----------
Monolith vs MicroService code architecture : explore it.

#useEffect hook :first the component render, as soon as render cycle finished , it calls the callback function
UseEffect is called with two arguements one is callback function & other is dependency array.
When useEffect called?
Three cases :

1.  if no dependency array , it is called on every rendering of the component
    e.g : useEffect(()=>{});
2.  If dependency array is empty , useEffect is called on initial render.(just once).
    e.g :useEffect(()=>{},[]);
    3.if dependency array is having value/stateVariables , useEffect called everytime when value/variable changes
    e.g :useEffect(()=>{},[value/stateVariables]);
    syntax :
    useEffect(()=>{},[]);

Shimmer UI : for better user experience creates a mock up pages till api loads the data.


-----class-7----
Routing :
npm install react-router-dom (version will be 6.4)
create a routing configuration in app.js (App router)
check App.js file
import {createBrowserRouter,RouterProvider,} from "react-router-dom";
Outlet
errorElement
Children routes
Link - we use link instead of anchor tag<a> because it nor refreshes the page. (behind the scenes link using anchor tag). Link is a wrapper over anchor tag.
Client side routing vs server side routing
SPA
Dynamic routing- different pages for different restraunt
2 types of routing :
1-Client side routing
2-Server side routing

-----Class-8------

Class based components :
Asked in the interview because of old projects
Que : why do we have to write super(props) in the classs based components?

- when a class is instantiated/class loads , a new instance created then constructed called then render then componentDidMount then ComponentDidUpdate then ComponentWillUnmount
  *Component did mount we used to make API call's once our component is mounted/loaded.
  *React will batch the render phase in reactt lifecycle hooks
  In lifecycle React is batching up the render phase of multiple childrens.
  Once the commit phase start React tries to update the DOM. DOM manipulation
  is the most expensive thing when we are updating a component it takes a lot of time.

What is Render phase ?-
In Render phase ,React is triggering the reconcialiation phase/process in which it finds out the difference between
two virtual DOM.Everythin happening in render phase in virtual DOM.
why Virtual DOM is fast?
-because virtual DOM is javascript, it deals with object.
-In render phase React is finding difference between two diff.
-Parent Constructor
-Parent Render
-First Child Constructor
-First Render

-Second Child Constructor
-Second Child Render

-Third Child Constructor
-Third Render

-First Child Component Did Mount

-Second Child Component Did Mount

-Third Child Component Did Mount

-Parent Comopnent Did mount

*Single Responsibility Principle 
-Modularity
-Reusable
-Maintainable
-Testable

-custom hooks
-they are also utility javacript function
-Always create custom hooks with pre name 'use'.
-While creating the custom hooks, first finalise the contract of the hooks
e.g. what will be the input of the hooks & what will be the output of the hooks

-optimising app includes -
-Bundling
-Chunking//Code Splitting// Dynamic Bundling
-Lazy loading/On Demand loading/ dynamic import
*For shortening the bundle size , we do code splitting like lazy loadnig

Separate bundle for separate compnent/features

--index.js:1 React Router caught the following error during render Error: A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition.
Note : this error will come while using the lazy loading , you have to resolve using 'suspense' component
-'fallback' in lazy uses for like spinner or loader
